# Unity Ray Tracing Attempt
This is a small first time attempt at ray tracing through compute shaders in Unity. This project was inspired by Sebastion Lague's video [here](https://youtu.be/Qz0KTGYJtUk?feature=shared).

## Plans:
 - Bounding Volume Optimization                     \(Work In Progress\)
 - Blended Normals                                  \(Not Started\)
 - Liquids, perhaps with custom noise scrolling     \(Not Started\)
 - Smoke and Heat Distortion                        \(Not Started\)
